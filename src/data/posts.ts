    content: `
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

It is based on components — small, reusable building blocks that manage their own UI.

In this post, you learned:
• What components are
• How JSX works
• Why React uses a virtual DOM
• How props help pass data between components

      "TypeScript helps catch bugs early and makes your code easier to understand.",
    content: `
TypeScript adds types to JavaScript.

With TypeScript in React, you can:
• Define props clearly
• Prevent runtime errors
• Improve IDE autocompletion
• Make large projects easier to maintain

This is why most modern React projects use TypeScript.

    excerpt:
      "Props and state are the heart of how data flows in React apps.",
    content: `
Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child.

State is used to store data that can change over time.

Together, they allow React apps to:
• Respond to user input
• Update the UI automatically
• Keep components independent and reusable

      "Learn how to handle user input using forms, events, and validation.",
    content: `
Forms are how users interact with your app.

In React you can:
• Use useState to control inputs
• Validate before submit
• Show error messages
• Update the UI instantly

Libraries like React Hook Form help simplify this process.
